# Brain

**
[Automating The Future](https://automatingthefuture.com) Is a blog that covers
a vast amount of Artificial Intelligence topics. Each Blog has code examples
associated with my study of Artificial Neural Networks. This Repo is specifically
designed from the ground up to illustrate all those code examples in a easy to
follow format.

In my effort to study more about the human brain and its' information processing
capabilities along with the help of the [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) programming language,
I've constructed this repo to serve as a go to place for ANN development
references. In each of my blog posts there will be code examples that can be seen
here.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `brain` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:brain, "~> 0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `brain` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:brain]]
    end
    ```
